Overview of the Analysis
In this analysis, I created a model to check its accuracy when predicting if a loan is healthy or non healthy based on the status provided by the lending company.

Results
The balanced accuracy score was 95%.

Precision score as shown in the report was 100% for healthy loans and 85% for non healthy loans. Meaning, healthy loans are predicted far more precise than not healthy loans.

Recall score was 99% for healthy loans and 91% for non healthy loans. The model was 99% accurate in measuring true positives for healthy loans, 91% accurate for non healthy loans.

Summary
The accuracy of this model to predict creditworthiness was 95%. However, to have a more reliable set of data we would need more samples of not healthy laons.
